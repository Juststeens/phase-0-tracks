So formatting a quick plan
start with googling the basics and writing out some codes. we'll need to figure out what jquery is, what it does and what it is used for.
THEN we tackle the basics.
can we make strings with it?
is it styling language?
is it mainly front end or backend?
is it like java? cause it sounds like java?
will we ever learn jquery?
find out next time on the next episode of
