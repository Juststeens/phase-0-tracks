My workflow could improve by commiting my work more frequently and practicing better indentation. naming my variables has caused me a lot of isssues, I began creating noticable differences in variable names so I wouldn't have any issues attempting to call one variable and ending up with another. I've begun indenting my work as I go, usually stopping after creating a small portion of code and cleaning it up to be sure that it is easily readable and organized, I try to remember to stop every so often to commit my work in case I need to revert my file back to an older form. I have significantly improved at reading error messages mostly out of neccessity, earlier an encounter with an error message would leave me floundering through my code until I had a miraculous discovery of the issue and took note. Other than these issues I try to keep in mind that others may be reading my code and that I should keep everything easily readable and identifiable such as methods and variables. I do this mainly by keeping the names of my variables and methods as specific to their purpose as possible as to not lead to any confusion.
