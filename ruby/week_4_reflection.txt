1. A variable is typically a word or phrase that has been given a value to run when it is called. Variables are used to hold data for use in programs.

2. When run in the order given the program will first read and acknowledge the value of first_name then last_name and finally full_name. the final result if the user runs puts, print or p will be "AbrahamLincoln" as a space was not provided within either string.

3.
string:placed between quotes usually containing a word or sentence.

integer: a fixed rounded number.

float: a fixed number with a decimal.

nil: nothing or false

boolean: a variable with two values: true or false

4. An algorithm is a set of steps repeated until an outcome is reached.

5. a loop and a method

6. a method is a set of steps and conditions defined in a variable

7.
return value: The outcome of calling  variable or method

side effect: an unexpected/ unwanted outcome of running a program.

Parameter: the expected return of a method

Argument: a value pushed through a method

implicit return: returning the implied result of a metho

8. a global scope is defined outside of a method or loop and can be accessed from anywhere in the program. a method scope is the variable defined within a method. the scope will determine the availability of a variable and where it can be called.

9. control flow is controlling the way a program is read to  optimize it's performance.

10.
Loop: a continuos repetitive cycle of repeating numbers, letters, or sentences.

if: a statement beginning with if (conditional) then output.

else: ending of if statement means if not any other conditional then output

elsif: follows if statement if this conditional then this output.

while: beginning of a loop while this conditional then this will happen.

until: until this conditional this output will continue.
